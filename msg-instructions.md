# Instructions for Selecting a Cold Email Option

When presented with multiple cold email options, use the following instructions to select the most appropriate one based on the provided person's information from `peoplefinder.json`.

## Understanding the Context

The `peoplefinder.json` file contains information about people, including their company, name, email, designation, and tech stack. This information should be used to personalize the email selection process.

## Email Options

You will be provided with several email options, each with a slightly different tone and approach. These options are designed to be used in different situations, depending on your relationship with the recipient and the context of your job search.

## Selection Criteria

1.  **Identify the Recipient:** Determine the recipient's name from the provided context.
2.  **Match Recipient to `peoplefinder.json`:** Look up the recipient's information in the `peoplefinder.json` file.
3.  **Assess Relationship:** Based on the recipient's designation and tech stack, infer the likely relationship with the sender. For example, if the recipient is a Data Scientist and the sender is applying for a Software Engineer role, the relationship might be more professional than if they were both Software Engineers.
4.  **Choose the Best Option:**
    *   **Option 1 (More Formal):** Use this option if the recipient is in a higher position or if the relationship is strictly professional.
    *   **Option 2 (Slightly More Casual):** Use this option if the recipient is a peer or if the relationship is friendly but still professional.
    *   **Option 3 (If You Haven't Connected in a While):** Use this option if you haven't interacted with the recipient recently.
5.  **Personalize the Email:** After selecting the best option, fill in the bracketed placeholders with the specific information for the sender and recipient.

## Example

If the recipient is "Jane Smith" and her designation is "Data Scientist", you might choose Option 1 or Option 2, depending on the context of the job application. If the recipient is "John Doe" and his designation is "Software Engineer", you might choose Option 2 or Option 3, depending on how long it has been since you last interacted.

## Key Points

*   Always prioritize the most relevant option based on the recipient's information.
*   Ensure the selected email is personalized with the correct details.
*   If there is no information about the recipient in `peoplefinder.json`, use Option 1 as a default.
